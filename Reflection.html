        <h2>The virtual process: How was it?</h2><br>
        <h2>In the span of two years, what were the most memorable moments?</h2><br><br>
        <h3>Capstone was not easy, along with challenges, there were good moments to be remembered. I like how capstone made me interact and collaborate with others. I also enjoyed the CAPSTONE project proposal itself because it made me think outside of the box and made me appreciate product sustainability more when it comes to devising a product proposal that would help the community and benefit the ecosystem.</h3>
        <br><br><br>
        <h2>Catching up: An Assessment</h2>
        <br>
        <h3>There were times where I would assess myself on the things I contributed, which was a first. With the set activities, group discussions, brainstorming, and presentations, it made me strengthen some of my weak academic areas and skill sets. The overall journey is rocky and imperfect, but through it all, the ride made me conquer fears, externalize accomplishments, and integrate hard work.</h3>

        <h2>Learnings:</h2>
    </center>
<h3>Not everyone will like you mentality</h3>
    <h3>-In anywhere we go as we display our excellence and willingness in a certain thing or passion, some people will likely be unconscious of how we work hard to achieve that goal. But to have this is a necessity as it made me realize to believe in my own conscious efforts and not seek validation from others.</h3>
   <br> <h3>We have to put ourselves out there to be seen</h3>
    <h3>-The most unsettling experience in my CAPSTONE journey was when we were finally presenting our proposal to panelists virtually. It was nerve-wrecking but it was such an important day yet I managed to brush off any nervous feelings and performed quite well in the Q and A portion. Also, I learned that we must work, work, work not only because it is necessary but it is a way of telling ourselves that there is no limit to our capabilities.</h3>
    <br><h3>Importance of sustainability</h3>
    <h3>-If I had not emphasized it enough, having sustainable and innovative goods and services save our planet and our community.</h3>
   <br><br><br>

    <h2>Struggles</h2><br><br>
    <h3>Time-management
        Bad sleeping schedules
        Often overwhelmed by pressure
        Difficulty in socializing
        Misinterpretations/Miscommunications</h3>
    </center><br><br><br>
    <h2>What comes next?</h2><br><br>
    <h3>I am grateful because as I graduate, the realizations and reflections I unlocked within this permanent learning experience let me carry multiple facets that will help me in the long-run. The experiences and values that I learned in my journey will be gradually yet tremendously be applied in all aspects of my life within such things such as my workplace, my household, and my inner mentality. CAPSTONE moved me to respond to global challenges</h3>
    <br>
    <h1>FINAL REFLECTION: </h1><br><br><br>
    <h3>Throughout my Capstone journey, I got filled with inseparable knowledge that I will carry on for the rest of my years as not only a student, but as an active member of society. Integrity, perseverance, fearlessness, responsibility, and wisdom are some of the core values that I accumulated in my journey. I was also enlightened by the numerous aspects that render our product to be what it is.</h3>
    <br>
    <h3>The endeavors I experienced and optimized are all valuable tools for me that reflect my immeasurable learning's and transcendent experiences. The early until the late stages of the production of our proposal is certainly a reminder that we should be an advocate for helping the world grow into a better place.</h3><br>
    <h3>There were struggles but I overcame them with my diligence. And through this journey, it made me refurnish and enhance my weaknesses into strengths. We should solely be the instrument of saving the world, healing the world from misuse of toxic goods and services, and ultimately the ones leading the fatal course of the growing future.</h3><br><br>
