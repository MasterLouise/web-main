        <p>Capstone is a culminative academic experience that integrates a student's knowledge and application of skill into work-related exhibitions. Through its practicality alone, it helps synthesize sustainable initiatives that give way to tangible solutions when combating a chosen issue of a specific community (Data Statistics 2022).</p><br>
        <p>The Capstone project is a beneficial preparation for the future because it is an investment that accomplishes set objectives. More often than not, the emphasis is towards the use of natural and environment-friendly goods and services.</p><br>
        <p>Capstone is an interactive work immersion that deals with strengthening studentâ€™s abilities to overcome academic challenges and to become ready for their future careers as it collates skill sets that are beneficial. </p><br>
