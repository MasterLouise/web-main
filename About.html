<p>Hello! I am Louise, a grade 12 student in the Humanities strand. 
    I believe in the pursuit of hard work and diligently carry this mindset 
    as I complete the academic tasks I have been given in the last semester 
    of the school year especially in subjects such as WICREA. 
    I plan to take BS Economics in the freshman year of my college in the 
    University of the Philippines Los Banos. Someday, I aspire to become a diplomat
    with an expertise in international relations and soar high in all my future goals. 
    My hobbies include journaling, digital designing, and sketching.</p><br>

    <p>
        My biggest strength is my strong will. Despite obstacles, either in my 
        life or in an academic setting, I persevere and keep my head held high which
         led me to become stronger and more fulfilled.
    </p><br>

    <p>
        <span> My Mission:</span>
As a student of De Lasalle Lipa, I hone my character to develop values of integrity, responsibility,
 and wisdom in my everyday life. With my acquired learnings and experiences, 
 I pass on excellence and a developed character when facing challenges. Hence, as a member of the 
 community too, I try to set a good example for others by contributing, being active, and thinking 
 critically of numerous matters so that I can share my valuable knowledge onto others. 
 The learnings I have learned in important subject matters such as WICREA, CAPSTONE, and INQUIRE pushed 
 me to develop senseful aspirations that urge me to foster growth, development, and collaboration within 
 my community.</p>
